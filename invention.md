### Methodology:

Generally, my innovations have revolved around building intelligent 5G wireless networks and beyond. I follow a very systematic method that starts with surveying the literature on the topic and the literature on other topics that have a similar nature to the current problem I am working on. This helps me build a good understanding of the problem at hand. Reading variant literature helps inspire possible innovative solutions that could be adopted from other fields to mobile networks. Once a possible novel solution is imagined in my head, I start drafting some proof of concept experiments and setups that I can build in the lab to gather appropriate proof of concept results. I then start the process of filing the patent where I build slides describing the idea that I present to experts in the field to look for their feedback. After careful scrutinization and a few rounds of edits, I proceed with the filing process. So far, I have filed a total of 10+ patents, some of which have been granted.

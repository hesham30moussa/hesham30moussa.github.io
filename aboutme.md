subtitle: Better future for our next generation

My name is Hesham Moussa. I am an engineer by profession, educator by heart, researcher by passion, and wonderer by nature:

- I love building things with purpose
- I am always eager to describe and explain how I built something
- I am passionate about discovering new ways of building stuff
- I am hopeless when it comes to putting limits to my imagination

Why do I do what I do?
Well, I am seeking a better future for myself, and I plan to leave Earth in a better shape than when I first inhabited it!

### Formal about-me

Currently, I am a senior research engineer with the wireless department at Huawei Technologies Canada where I am working on topics related to AI applications in smart 6G mobile networks of the future.

I completed my Ph.D. in wireless communication in January 2020 from the University of Waterloo under the supervision of Professor Weihua Zhuang where I was part of the [BBCR lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/broadband-communications-research-lab/). My thesis focuses on developing novel wireless channel access frameworks more suitable for the anticipated future cellular applications where I employed a mixture of concepts including queueing theory, game theory, probability theory, machine learning, and stochastic geometry.

I completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Electrical and Computer engineering at the American University of Sharjah, Sharjah, UAE in 2015 with a focus on biomedical applications under the supervision of Dr. Ghaleb Al-Husseini and Dr. Nasser Qaddoumi. My research focused on developing an intelligent drug release control system from novel drug nano-encapsulators known as
Pegylated-Liposomes.
